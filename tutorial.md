#Deeper git usage
Rebasing

Assuming that you creat a branch 'mywork' on your remote branch 'master'.

```
$git checkout -b mywork origin
```

After switch to it you make some change 

```
$touch file
$git add file
$git commit -m "add file"
```

On the same time  your colleague have pulled two requests to origin branch ,which means the 'master' and 'mywork'  will have conflict on each other. It is similiar to the 'Merge conflict' you have encountered in lab1.

But merge will creat a new merge commit on 'master' which you dont want to commit. You want to keep the commits on the 'mywork' branch without merge, then you can use git rebase:
```
$git checkout mywork
$git rebase origin
```

This command will save all your commits in 'mywork' under a directory '.git/rebase' in patch format. When you updated origin to "already up-to-date" the patch will patch back to new 'mywork' without leaving merge commits.

Once your 'mywork' point to a new commit, the old one will be through away. If you run 
```
$git gc
```
(garbage collection), they may be removed.

If the rebase process find a conflict, after you fix the conflict, use git add and continue with
```
$git rebase --continue
```

or you want to back to status before rebase, run
```
$git rebase --abort
```
